# An implementation of Affine Matrix Ball Construction

Affine Matrix Ball Construction is a combinatorial algorithm which gives a bijection between the collection of (extended) affine permutations and triples (P, Q, rho) where the first two elements are "tabloids" and the last is a "dominant weight". The preprint introducing the algorithm lives [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05861).

## Operation

* The file AMBC.jar should be runnable on any machine that have Java Runtime Environment
* Use arrows to get around the infinite matrix
* Use SHIFT + arrows to move around the red grid
* Desired permutation can be entered in lower part of window (make sure to press ENTER at the end)
* Desired permutation size (n) can be entered in corresponding box (pressing ENTER gives a random permutation of this size)
* Degree of spread in randomness controlled by remaining bottom box
* Matrix Ball Construction is controlled by arrows with label "AMBC" in the top right corner, or keyboard
* P, Q, and rho can be entered directly into boxes. Make sure to press ENTER after entering each of them.
