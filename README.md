An implementation of Affine Matrix Ball Construction

*Use arrows to get around the infinite matrix
*Use SHIFT + arrows to move around the red grid
*Desired permutation can be entered in lower part of window (make sure to press ENTER at the end)
*Desired permutation size (n) can be entered in corresponding box (pressing ENTER gives a random permutation of this size)
*Degree of spread in randomness controlled by remaining bottom box
*Matrix Ball Construction is controlled by arrows with label "AMBC" in the top right corner, or keyboard
*P, Q, and rho can be entered directly into boxes. Make sure to press ENTER after entering each of them.
